# Introduction 
Packers is a funny game that is intended to make people more aware of environment while laughing.
The inspiration behind it comes from looking at what people do and the old packman game.

The project was originally uploaded into the GitHub account of the creator, then he decided to move to Azure to have a better access on things.
